 *
 * All data exchanges relating to a specific database are done using
 * datasets.  A dataset is a table of records.  A description of the
 * records, including the record size and access mode, is given by a
 * table definition.  A table definition may be expanded to include field
 * sizes and locations.  Field definitions are themselves stored in a
 * separate dataset.
 *
 * The access flags indicate if the data are stored in network-byte order.
 * Clients may use this to determine if byte-swapping is necessary on
 * fields where byte order is not specified (DBF_TYPE_U16, DBF_TYPE_U32,
 * DBF_TYPE_U64).
 *
 * The id field specifies the data to return in response to a query.  In
 * most cases, the id field will specify the id of a database or table,
 * indicating that the query should return all data in the database or
 * table, respectively.  If an id field contains DB_ID_DEFS, the response
 * should return definitions, such as the table definitions for a database,
 * or field definitions for a table.
 *
 * The epoch value is used to track changes to the dataset.  The epoch
 * value is incremented anytime a transaction has modified, added, or
 * removed data from a dataset.  The epoch value may be treated as a
 * static version number if the dataset is not expected to change during
 * execution.  This is the case when the dataset contains a listing of
 * table or field definitions.
 *
 * The dataset structure may be used to reference a subset of a larger
 * dataset.  All fields of db_dataset are relative to the current set of
 * records being referenced.  The set_size field indicates the size of
 * the dataset, in bytes.  The set_offset field is used to identify the
 * location of the dataset's first record of relative to a larger dataset.
 * The set_offset is 0 if the dataset is not a subset.  The set_count is
 * only valid if the records are of fixed sized and lists the number of
 * records in the dataset.

 *
 * Creating new database should be done through the following steps:
 *
 * [1] The following structures have to be defined:
 *
 *        - struct db_table_def []	containing all database tables defs.
 *          example:
 *             static const struct db_table_def def_arr[] = {
 *                 { table_1 definitions },
 *                 { table_1 field definitions },
 *                 ...
 *                 { 0 }
 *             };
 *
 *        - struct db_dataset []	containing all datasets, 1 for data
 *                                      tables and 1 for field definition
 *                                      tables.
 *          example:
 *             static const struct db_dataset dataset_arr[] = {
 *                 { dataset_1 definitions },
 *                 { dataset_2 definitions },
 *                 ...
 *                 { 0 }
 *             };
 *
 *             static const struct db_dataset field_dataset_arr[] = {
 *                 { dataset_1 field definitions },
 *                 { dataset_2 field definitions },
 *                 ...
 *                 { 0 }
 *             };
 *
 *        - struct db_field_def []	containing data tables field defs.
 *          example:
 *             static const struct db_field_def field_arr[] = {
 *                { table_1 field_1 definitions },
 *                { table_1 field_2 definitions },
 *                ...
 *                { table_2 field_1 definitions },
 *                { table_2 field_2 definitions },
 *                ...
 *                { 0 }
 *             };
 *
 * [2] ssa_db_create() has to be called with the following arguments:
 *
 *         - p_num_recs_arr		an array containing number of records
 *                                      for each table in database.
 *
 *         - p_recs_size_arr		an array containing record sizes
 *                                      for each table in database.
 *
 *         - p_num_field_recs_arr       an array containing the number of
 *                                      fields contained in table records.
 *
 *         - tbl_cnt			the number of data tables.
 *
 * [3] ssa_db_init() method has to be called with the arguments that
 *     were defined at stage 1.
